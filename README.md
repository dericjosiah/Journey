After trying to break into the industry, I realized just studuying for a test wasn't enough. You need to be hands on, and apply that knowledge in real-world scenarios through the workforce, or labs. So, here I am, rolling  into the highways of information technology with a focus on upgrading my practical skills trough TryHackMe, and HackTheBox. The goal is to become a techonological guru personally, as well as in the workforce.

## Projects and Learning Path
# Projects

1. Elk-Project

* **Description:** In this project I am creating a IaC behind a SIEM, Kibana. This is done using Microsoft Azure, integrating a SIEM system with Kibanaa, setting up a jump-provisioner VM for secure, and efficient server managment, as well as set firewall rules.

* **Skills Learned:** I this project I learned to create a jump box to move beteween and moinotr both web server, and Elk servers. I also created a load balancer to distribute the network traffic, although there is a single webserver. In the web server, and Elk servers I created docker containers for DVWA, and Kibana, then edited the /etc/systct.conf file to set the configuration max map count on boot. Once the servers were configured, I downloaded file beat onto the webserver to push the log from the web servere to the Elk server. I did this so we can view it througb elastic.co. In doing this, we can monitor the logs in a more user-friendly way. In the NSGs, I configured them to only allow access from sources I recongize to reduce othes ability to access the machine. 

* **Outcome:** This project ended with me being able to monitor network traffic through the Elastic, and being able to detect intrusions to the Network with no false-negatives. 

## Certifications and Courses

* **CompTIA Security+ SYO-701:** Successfully passed the certification exam, gaining a solid foundation in cybersecurity principles, and renewed through attending seminars, as well as continual education.

* **Splunk Certified User:** Successfully obtained the beginner level Splunk user certification. In doing so I gained competency in using this SIEM.

## Learning Path

* **Threats and Vulnerabilities:** Studying common threats and vulnerabilities, and understanding how to mitigate them.
* **Networking Basics:** Learning about the OSI model, TCP/IP, and basic networking concepts.
* **Linux Systems Administration:** Gaining proficiency in Linux systems administration to better understand and secure systems.
* **Windows System Administration:** Gaining proficiency in Windows system administration to better understand, and secure systems.

## Future Goals

* **Advanced Certifications:** Aim to achieve advanced certifications such as CISSP, CCNA, and more.
* **Hands-on Experience:** Participate in more practical projects, internships, and collaborative efforts to gain real-world experience.
* **Community Involvement:** Engage with the IT community through forums, conferences, and networking events to share knowledge and learn from others. I have taken steps to this by participating in the Wild West Hacking Fest, and National Cyber League.

## Conclusion
This portfolio is a testament to my commitment to becoming a skilled informational technology professional. By continuously documenting my progress, I aim to improve my skills, gain valuable experience, and contribute to the  field.
